Please note that this code is hardware-specific (to the hardware that khyperia has in her setup). As such, it's not exactly intended for use outside of a personal project - but if you find a use for it, fantastic! :)

My hardware:

* Two [ZWO/ASI](https://astronomy-imaging-camera.com/) cameras. One is the guidescope, one is the primary imager (with cooling). Software in this repo is generic to all ZWO/ASI cameras.
* Skywatcher NEQ6 Pro. Software in this repo is generic to all synscan telescopes.
